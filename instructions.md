# Developer Challenge

## Why?

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to undertake tasks that will be performed at [our company] on a daily basis. There are no requirements as to how you achieve the following, but we would prefer you to demonstrate your abilities in the technologies we use. This is predominantly JavaScript, but we will accept submissions in other languages provided they work. This project exists so that we can discuss it with you at our in-person interview as well as understand how you approach and solve problems.

## Task

The idea behind this project is to consume an API and display it in an interactive way. This will demonstrate your understanding of web technologies and ability to follow a specification. The task is to fetch information on the top 100 cryptocurrencies (by market capitalization) and display them in an interactive way. If you require any further clarifications, please feel free to reach out [to the hiring manager].

## Requirements

1. Fetch the top 100 cryptocurrencies sorted by market cap from a public API. (eg. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com))
2. Show the data as a list and allow sorting by name, position (market cap), and current price.
3. Also allow searching by name.

## Suggestions

* [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) is a good, well-documented API for fetching this information.
* Consider how you handle requests to allow for a responsive user interface.
	* eg. Let the user know that data is loading.
* Transform the received data into a more readable format.
* Use a JavaScript front-end framework to display the data such as React or Vue
	* We will accept other frameworks if you are more comfortable (eg. Django).

This is a simple project with no extra features required. How you style and present the data is up to you as long as the functionality requirements are met. Feel free to add any other features you would like as long as it does not prevent the above requirements. However, you should only do this if you feel it will demonstrate a particular skill or interest.
