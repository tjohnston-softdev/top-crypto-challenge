# Top Crypto Challenge

This is my submission for a technical assessment offered to shortlisted candidates for one of the software development positions that I applied for. The idea is to consume a public API for [Cryptocurrency information](https://www.coingecko.com/en) and display it in a way that is useful and interactive.

Assessment instructions were sent as a PDF. I reinterpreted it as a [markdown file](./instructions.md) for public viewing.

This attempt was developed across 10-13 September 2021 and immediately shared to the general public.
